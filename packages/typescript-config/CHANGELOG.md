## 1.0.1-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- b49b563: Move the `bun-types` dependency to the typescript-config package.

## 1.0.1-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- Move everything to a monorepo. Run `bun install` and `bun start` to get started with the new repo. Also be aware that the codebase has been moved to `apps/tako` and thus your `.env.production` needs to be there as well.
