With `/autoroles`, you can set up to assign roles to users or aps when they join your server. The autoroles list is seperated between users and bots, so you can assign different roles to each.

## Usage/Subcommands

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="User">
        `/autoroles user <role>`

        **Example**:
        `/autoroles user @Member` will add the `@Member` role to the autoroles list for users, and if executed again, it will be removed.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="App">
        `/autoroles app <role>`

        **Example**:
        `/autoroles app @App` will add the `@App` role to the autoroles list for apps, and if executed again, it will be removed.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="List">
        `/autoroles list`
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Permissions

In order to use the `/autoroles` subcommands, you need the `Manage Server` & `Manage Roles` permisions.

You can change the permisions via `Server Settings > Integrations > Tako` in your Discord server.

## Options

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Role">The role to toggle in the selected autoroles list.</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How it works

Each server has a list of autoroles for users and apps. The list is seperated between users and apps, so you can assign different roles to each.

When a user or an app joins the server, the app will check if the user or app has any roles in the autoroles list and assign them if they do.
