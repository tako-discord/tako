With `/auto-react`, you can set up emojis that will be automatically be used to react on every new message sent in a channel. This can be useful for example to create a voting system or increase activity in read-only channels.

## Usage/Subcommands

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Add">
        `/auto-react add <emoji> [channel]`
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Remove">
        `/auto-react remove <emoji> [channel]`
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="List">
        `/auto-react list [channel]`
    </TabItem>

## Options

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Emoji">
		The emoji to add or remove from the auto-reactions list. This can either be a custom emoji or a unicode/default
		emoji. You can just type in the emoji like you would in the regular chatbox.
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Channel">
		<Badge text="Default: The channel you execute the command from" />
		The channel to add, remove or list auto-reactions.
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How it works

Once you have any emojis added to the auto-reactions list of a channel, those emojis will be automatically added as reactions to every new message sent in that channel.

Please note that if you provide an emoji that can't be accessed by the app, it will be removed from the auto-reactions list automatically.
That means that if you use a custom emoji, the app needs to have access to the server where the emoji is from.
