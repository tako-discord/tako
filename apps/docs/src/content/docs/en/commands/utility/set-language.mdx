:::tip
You will get suggestions for a long list of languages when you are focused on the `language` option. This will allow for searching for languages by their name.
If your language isn't being suggested you can also use an [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) two letter language code.
